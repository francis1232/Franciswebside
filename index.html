         <p>Environmental Protection includes programs that are aimed at reducing risks to the environment from contaminants such as hazardous materials and wastes, fuels, and oils.  These programs address pollution prevention measures and regulatory compliance by providing procedures for safely working with these materials, inspecting the storage vessels and locations, and designating preventative maintenance procedures.  Also included are environmental emergency plans, which provide the appropriate actions to be taken in the event of a spill or release.

        <p> Our environment is what houses and helps our ecosystem grow and thrive. Without protecting and taking care of our environment we’re putting so many lives at danger such as animals, plants and crops, and even our own.

All of the ecosystems that make up our environment are deeply connected. One change to an ecosystem could completely change the dynamic that has been created. There are many ways that you can help our ecosystem as well as protecting the environment.

            <p>Another “R” that doesn’t get much attention but has important environmental implications is “rot.” As in, let your food and yard waste rot naturally in the soil instead of sending it to the landfill. In other words: compost.

Composting your food scraps and yard waste offers double rewards: it keeps an incredible amount of trash out of the waste stream, and it produces free, rich soil to use in your garden. Some cities now pick up organic waste alongside regular trash and recycling pick up. If your area doesn’t offer this service, no worries— you can set up a low-maintenance compost pile in your backyard.
